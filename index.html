I am a mechanical engineer passionate about creating meaningful products with the capacity to help people. I currently work for Clippard Inc. in Cincinnati, OH where I design products for various medical applications. I started this role in 2023 after graduating from the University of Notre Dame with a degree in mechanical engineering. My favorite type of work as an engineer involves plenty of hands on prototype development guided by simulations and CAD. Additionally, I love wearing many hats - both inside of and outside of engineering - and would be open to both engineering and engineering adjacent roles. More information about my job and who I am can be found below - as well as contact information if you think I would be a good fit for your company!

								<h2>New Product Development at Clippard Inc.</h2>

							<p align="left"> 

My time at <a href="https://www.clippard.com">Clippard </a> has led to a marked improvement in my skills as an engineer and my understanding of pneumatics as a whole. Some of the projects that I have lead or contributed to while at Clippard are listed below:							</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Oxygen Blender for a Baby Resuscitator</li>
									<li>Proportional Flow Pinch Valve</li>
									<li><a href="https://www.clippard.com/part/configure/CHV">Proportional Pressure Controller</a></li>
  									<li><a href="https://www.clippard.com/part/configure/NPV-P">Panel Mounted Pinch Valves</a></li>
								</ul> 
							<p align="left">
							Some of the software I use to complete these projects includes Solidworks and Luminary (CFD). Once we are ready for prototypes we will often combine machining and 3D printing parts in our prototypes to get a fully functional beta as fast as possible. Once the design has been proven out, we will then construct a life test fixture unique for that product to ensure it meets all specifications.    
							</p>

							
							<p align="left">
								My familiarity with pneumatics has also greatly grown from my time at Clippard. In June of 2024 I received the title of Pneumatic Specialist from the International Fluid Power Society after passing their exam. This greatly expanded my knowledge on topics like pneumatic circuitry and has helped to create better products as a result.

Before joining Clippard I previously interned at Yaskawa as a product engineer. While there I worked on their Semistar Gekko robot (pictured on the right) which autonomously handled silicone wafers throughout their manufacturing process. For the duration of the internship I was responsible for maintaining and recording life tests, as well as ensuring the betas adhered to all relevant specifications before being shipped to customers.

<br />								 
Throughout my undergrad degree at Notre Dame I worked as a fabricator for the Notre Dame Innovation Lab. While there I interacted with local business owners and grad students to take the ideas in their head and bring them to life. This lead to plenty of hands on experience with software like Solidworks and machines like laser cutters and 3D printers.

								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<p>
							Outside of work I love staying physically active - whether thats playing on a club Ultimate Frisbee team or going rock climbing at Red River Gorge. Beyond the obvious physical benefits, these activities help to promote high level teamwork, trust, and problem solving. I also recently started volunteering at a dog shelter to clean and care for the dogs which includes socializing them to prepare them for their forever home. Additionally I spend a lot of time taking pictures on my Canon AE-1 Program, a 35mm film camera, displaying the history and architecture of Cincinnati or wherever I happen travel with it (pictures seen below).
