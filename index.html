I am a mechanical engineer passionate about creating meaningful products with the capacity to help people. I currently work for Clippard Inc. in Cincinnati, OH where I design products for various medical applications. I started this role in 2023 after graduating from the University of Notre Dame with a degree in mechanical engineering. My favorite type of work involves hands on prototype development but I also love wearing many hats and am open to many types of engineering roles. More information about my job and who I am can be found below - as well as contact information if you think I would be a good fit for your company!

My time at <a href="https://www.clippard.com">Clippard </a> has led to a marked improvement in my skills as an engineer and my understanding of pneumatics as a whole. Some of the projects that I have lead or contributed to during my time at Clippard can be seen below:

I have also worked to verify and design products like the <a href="https://www.clippard.com/part/configure/CHV">proportional pressure controller</a> and a stepper driven proportional pinch valve among other things. My familiarity with pneumatics has also greatly grown from my time at Clippard. In June of 2024 I received the title of Pneumatic Specialist from the International Fluid Power Society after passing their exam. This includes topics like pneumatic circuitry analysis, troubleshooting, and proper cylinder use among others. This certification really helped me to better understand the context of the valves I was making in the system as a whole, leading to more intelligent design choices as a result.

Before joining Clippard I previously interned at Yaskawa as a product engineer. While there I worked on their Semistar Gekko robot (pictured on the right) which autonomously handled silicone wafers throughout their manufacturing process. For the duration of the internship I was responsible for maintaining and recording life tests, as well as ensuring the beta units adhered to all relevant specifications before being shipped to customers.

Throughout my undergrad degree at Notre Dame I worked as a fabricator for the Notre Dame Innovation Lab. While there I interacted with local business owners and grad students to take the ideas in their head and bring them to life. This lead to plenty of hands on experience with software like Solidworks and machines like laser cutters and 3D printers.

								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<p>
							Outside of work I love staying physically active - whether thats playing on a club Ultimate Frisbee team or going rock climbing at Red River Gorge. Obviously these keep me physically active but also promote high level teamwork, trust, and problem solving. I also recently started volunteering at a dog shelter to clean and care for the dogs which includes socializing them to prepare them for their forever home. Additionally I spend a lot of time taking pictures on my Canon AE-1 Program, a 35mm film camera, displaying the history and architecture of Cincinnati or wherever I happen travel with it (pictures seen below).
