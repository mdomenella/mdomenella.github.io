I am a mechanical engineer passionate about creating meaningful products with the capacity to help people. I currently work for Clippard Inc. in Cincinnati, OH where I design products for various medical applications. I started this role in 2023 after graduating from the University of Notre Dame with a degree in mechanical engineering. My favorite type of work as an engineer involves plenty of hands on prototype development guided by simulations and CAD. Additionally, I love wearing many hats - both inside of and outside of engineering - and would be open to both engineering and engineering adjacent roles. More information about my job and who I am can be found below - as well as contact information if you think I would be a good fit for your company!

								<h2>New Product Development at Clippard Inc.</h2>
							</header>
							<p align="left"> 

My time at <a href="https://www.clippard.com">Clippard </a> has led to a marked improvement in my hard skills as an engineer and my familiarity with manufacturing as a whole. Some of the projects that I have lead or contributed to are listed below:
							</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Oxygen Blender for a Baby Resuscitator</li>
									<li>Proportional Flow Pinch Valve</li>
									<li><a href="https://www.clippard.com/part/configure/CHV">Proportional Pressure Controller</a></li>
  									<li><a href="https://www.clippard.com/part/configure/NPV-P">Panel Mounted Pinch Valves</a></li>
								</ul> 
							<p align="left">
							My daily use of Solidworks since joining Clippard has grown my real world experience with it immensely - particularly when it comes to designing a product that is ready for manufacturing. Our team also relies on CFD to help get the first prototypes as close to what we need before any part is machined. The ability to effectively use and trust these two tools has proven to be incredibly valuable in reducing the time we spend developing a new product. Once the prototypes are made, whether 3D printed or machined, we are responsible for designing fixtures to validate them - ensuring that they meet all specifications.  
							</p>

							
							<p align="left">
								Hard skills are only half of the picture, however, as the final product is only as good as the chemistry inside the team and the relationships with the machinists and product managers outside the team. Creating a good product requires maintaining clear communications and explicit expectations - so entering a team that supports this is crucial for me.

								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<p>
							Outside of work I love staying physically active - whether thats playing on a club Ultimate Frisbee team or going rock climbing at Red River Gorge. Obviously these keep me physically active but also promote high level teamwork, trust, and problem solving. I also recently started volunteering at a dog shelter to clean and care for the dogs which includes socializing them to prepare them for their forever home. Additionally I spend a lot of time taking pictures on my Canon AE-1 Program, a 35mm film camera, displaying the history and architecture of Cincinnati or wherever I happen travel with it (pictures seen below).
